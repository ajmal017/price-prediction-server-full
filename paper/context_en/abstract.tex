In this research, we study the problem of stock market forecasting using Recurrent
Neural Network(RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The purpose of this
research is to examine the feasibility and performance of LSTM in stock market
forecasting. We optimize the LSTM model by testing different configurations, i.e., the
number of neurons in hidden layers and number of samples in sequence. Instead of
using daily stock price data, we collect hourly stock data from the IQFEED database in
order to train our model with relatively low noise samples. Nevertheless, based on the
prediction results of LSTM model, we build up a stock database with six U.S market
stocks from five different industries. The average test accuracy of these six stocks is
54.83%, where the highest accuracy is at 59.5% while the lowest is at 49.75%. We then
develop a trade simulator to evaluate the performance of our model by investing the
portfolio within a period of 400 hours, the total profit gained by the model is
$413,233.33 with $6,000,000 initial investment.
